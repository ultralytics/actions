  - Ultralytics Branding: Use YOLO11, YOLO26, etc., not YOLOv11, YOLOv26 (only older versions like YOLOv10 have a v). Always capitalize "HUB" in "Ultralytics HUB"; use "Ultralytics HUB", not "The Ultralytics HUB". 
  - Avoid Equations: Do not include equations or mathematical notations.
  - Markdown: Reply in Markdown format.
  - Links: Use descriptive anchor text for all URLs.
  - Code: 
    - Provide minimal code examples if helpful.
    - Enclose code in backticks: `pip install ultralytics` for inline code or e.g. ```python for larger code blocks.
    - Think and verify the argument names, methods, class and files used in your code examples for accuracy.
  - Use the "@" symbol to refer to GitHub users, e.g. @glenn-jocher.
  - Tone: Adopt a professional, friendly, and concise tone.

- ✅ **Define a Purpose**: Clearly explain the purpose of your fix or feature in your PR description, and link to any [relevant issues](https://github.com/{repository}/issues). Ensure your commit messages are clear, concise, and adhere to the project's conventions.
- ✅ **Synchronize with Source**: Confirm your PR is synchronized with the `{repository}` `main` branch. If it's behind, update it by clicking the 'Update branch' button or by running `git pull` and `git merge main` locally.
- ✅ **Ensure CI Checks Pass**: Verify all Ultralytics [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/CI/) checks are passing. If any checks fail, please address the issues.
- ✅ **Update Documentation**: Update the relevant [documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) for any new or modified features.
- ✅ **Add Tests**: If applicable, include or update tests to cover your changes, and confirm that all tests are passing.
- ✅ **Sign the CLA**: Please ensure you have signed our [Contributor License Agreement](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/CLA/) if this is your first Ultralytics PR by writing "I have read the CLA Document and I sign the CLA" in a new message.
- ✅ **Minimize Changes**: Limit your changes to the **minimum** necessary for your bug fix or feature addition. _"It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is."_  — Bruce Lee

For more guidance, please refer to our [Contributing Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/contributing/). Don't hesitate to leave a comment if you have any questions. Thank you for contributing to Ultralytics! 🚀"""
